# Quotes Generator  

Quotes Generator is a web-based application that displays quotes randomly. This app is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **JSON**. Users can display a new quote by clicking the **Refresh** or **Next Quote button**. Additionally, if a user clicks on an author's name, the app will open a new search tab based on that author's name.

2. Users can click the **Refresh** or **Next Quote** button to get a new quote.
3. If a user clicks on the author's name, a new tab will open with the search results for that author.
